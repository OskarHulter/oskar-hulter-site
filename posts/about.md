-misc design data-viz agile lean kanban

Specialized in semantic HTML, modern CSS, JavaScript ES20xx & its
ecosystem. I'm up to date about the newest trends but I
always try to choose the right tool for the job. I know that my
greatest asset isn't knowledge about flavour of the month
frameworks, but in my reasoning about the trade-offs they offer.

## Tools

My favorite JS tools are react, webpack, cypress, styled-components
& gatsby.

Design patterns, testing, software architecture &
declarative/functional programming are the technical topics I am
most excited about at the moment.

enjoy design & UX work because I'm motivated by impacting
end-users in a direct way. I don't mind database management, but
delegating that responsibility to a third party allows me to focus
on delivering an awesome user experience. The methodologies I
embrace in my work are Agile, Lean Software Development & Kanban.

However, my curiosity is not limited to the technical realm.
I am interested in systems thinking in the broadest sense,
covering topics like business processes and understanding customer
needs. My thoughts on these topics are mostly influenced by the lean
methodology. I studied lean during my time at LTU and it deeply
resonates with my personal core values. The lean principles are all
important tools in my tool belt that I find useful in many different
areas.

The art of writing clean code that is concise, consistent, elegant
and readable is a fulfilling challenge that I try to get better at
each day.
would love to apply & learn more about machine learning in
the long term.

## My Story

My passion for computers started at the age of six.

Specifically, around the time my step-father wrote a note
explaining the steps to launch Warcraft 2 from MS-DOS.

That note became a portal to another world.
A world which I embraced.

- A lot has  since 1997, but my passion remained.

After a time of pursuing other interests, studying, traveling and
working day-jobs I finally realized that my true calling had been
there all along.
I finished my bachelor's degree in Systems Science at Lule√•
Tekniska Universitet, 2018.
My thesis was an exploratory case-study about improving
software documentation using data visualization. The result of the
study indicates that data-visualization can be a potent tool for
making software documentation easier to understand.

Since then, I've focused my attention on modern web development.

## My Personality

I definitely have an analytical mindset.
This is reflected in my three biggest interests: music,
strategy games & programming.

As with any personality trait, an analytical mindset brings both
opportunities and challenges. I really enjoy the process of
learning, working on my craft, experiencing new realizations and the
fulfillment of solving problems efficiently. I am always looking for
another angle, to find new insights.

My primary challenge is that I am susceptible to analysis paralysis.
I try to remedy this by acknowledging that no solution has to be
perfect from the start. Even if you start building something that
isn't the most efficient solution, you'll still learn more about
what's needed than if you sit around and think.

enjoy working with other people & I am very talkative for
being an introvert. One of my core values is to always leave my ego
at the door and take every opportunity to improve. This means that I
value feedback from others, even if it could be construed as
criticism.

Currently I am developing a website called stressless.productions
that will host royalty-free music. It is still under construction
but I will post more info when I've come a bit further along. I am
also in the process of creating a webshop called festivaltent.shop
offering tents with fun patterns. This project is a bit more
experimental but it's a fun learning experience.
